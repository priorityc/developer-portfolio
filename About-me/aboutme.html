  <h2>About me</h2>
  <h3 class='underline'>From full time mum to Front end Developer</h3>
  
  <h3 class='underline'>First steps in Tech</h3>
  <p>I have been always that design person who whant to see the result of my work and thru all my life I was trying to find out and enjoy what I do. Browsing to google for any start point to get to know development better I decide to try a free short course with Rasbery P fondation to learn the fundamentals of Web Development and at the same time I was reserching what is to be in that career.I was suprised that even that I didn`t like to spend a lots of time in front of the screen I was enjoying so much to see the value of designing and developing.</p>
  <h3 class='underline'>Keep moving forward</h3>
  <p>After gaining knowlidge on Web development fundamentals, I decide to get into practise diving deep into the field.I have been acepted to join Front end Development course in Purple Beard Bootscamp and was really great opportunity to gain the proffesional skills I wanted.During the three months online intensive training I learned so much that I can`t even imagine But I also find out that Programing languages are not easy. I was facing a lot of challanging situation, that somethimes I just wanted to stop and think: 'Wait what am I doing and why I am doing that?',but than I remind myself 'This is what I want and enjoy to do, there is no need to strugle that much'. I am that kind of person that never give up and always serch for a solution, and purhaps I found it.</p>
  <h3 class='underline'>It is time to evolve</h3>
  <p>The solution to getting into hard time with understanding JavaScript was practice, practice and again practice. It is like when you want to learn Chinese but can`t get into that point. The coding languages are simply like translating one language to another so the computer can understand what to do. I already have several projects designing myself at my spare time, including this portfolio which is builded and designed from scrach. The design was something that rediscover after geting into paid course from Udemy. Compleatlly evolved my knowlidge with JavaScript whith that very well structured and easy explained content.   </p>
  <h3 class='underline'> The Internship</h3>
  <p>There is no better way to learn from mentors they are more experince and they can give a really good start for Junior. The intern I was acepted at Ciberinitiation, early Jully/22 was a great advantage and experince to learn from Senior developers. We were group of team Front end Developers working on Projects for developing further skills. That was my first oportunity to get into real work environment, but I can also consider myself experince as much as effective as the Internship.</p>
  <h3 class='underline'>The last but not least big step</h3>
  <p>This is my second Bachelor that I started at 2022 and already learned tons of new skills one of it is The Service management which is the important part of Project managment. This module gives me the concept of proffessional development process and I hoppe in the near future I can have those vallued skills and experiance too. Untill then I continue to follow my goal- secure a position as Junior Developer and I am sure that behind my strenght and the weekness I have something to bring to your organisation- soft skills developed with years and passion to be the best to my alocated job role.</p>
